# WPT testing for AAMs

This document explores the possibility of writing WPT tests for the AAM specifications.

## Overview

The Accessiblity API Mapping (AAM) specifications ([Core-AAM](https://www.w3.org/TR/core-aam-1.2/), [HTML-AAM](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aam-1.0/), potentially [MathML-AAM](https://w3c.github.io/mathml-aam/), [CSS-AAM](https://w3c.github.io/css-aam/)) describe how user agents should expose semantics of web content languages to accessibility APIs.

These documents, taken together, describe how the browser should build an accessibility tree for each web page, and how the tree should be mapped to various accessibility platform APIs.

As of today, we don't have an automated way to test these specifications, the way we do for other web specifications.
We'd like to explore what we would need to implement in order to be able to write fully automated tests for platform accessiblity API mappings.

### The Accessibility Tree and Accessibility APIs
![Diagram showing the interaction between a browser and accessibility APIs. See text below for more detail.](assets/accessibility_apis.png)

<summary>Full image description</summary>
A block diagram.

At the top level it shows an assistive technology application, such as a screen reader using speech or braille, communicating via Plaform Accessibility APIs with a Browser application.

Within the Browser application, it shows that the Assistive Technology is communicating via a Platform API mapping which is an adapter for the computed accessibility tree data structure.
In turn, the computed accessibility tree is built based on other data structures: the DOM tree and the layout/box tree; the layout/box tree is based on the DOM tree and CSS.

The computed accessibility tree falls in the centre of the diagram, as it's the source of truth for the platform API mappings which are queried by assistive technology, and also the result of a complex process of transformation based on several other data structures.

At the bottom of the diagram is a legend explaining how to read the different types of arrows and boxes used in the diagram.

Assistive technologies (ATs) query the browser via platform accessibility APIs. These are operating system-specific APIs which provide detailed information about an application's UI state for the purpose of augmenting the user experience for users with disabilities which affect their ability to perceive or operate the standard UI.

One example of a commonly used AT is a screen reader, which assists users with vision impairments by providing a spoken version of the UI.
Typically, a screen reader user will navigate through the UI by traversing the page and "visiting" UI elements, hearing a spoken description of each such as "Overview, heading level 2" or "Core-AAM, link".

The accessibility APIs allow this by making extensive data available about the UI, in the form of a tree structure referred to as the "accessibility tree".
The accessibility tree provides information about each UI element (often corresponding to a DOM node), allowing screen readers to provide these spoken descriptions.
Each platform's accessibility APIs provide methods to query the tree structure, and the information available for each node.

They also typically provide ways to interact with the UI, such as sending a "click" action to the currently visited UI element, or selecting a particular option from a picker.
Also, they provide ways for the UI to provide real-time updates or alerts in case of UI changing in a way that should be brought to the user's attention.

### The computed accessibility tree

Since browser engines are typically platform-independent, typically they will compute a generic accessibility tree which can be adapted to any platform's accessibility APIs.
The platform APIs are typically supported using an adapter which maps the platform API on to data from the computed accessibility tree.

### AAM specifications

The AAM specifications provide mappings between web technologies such as ARIA and HTML, and platform accessibility APIs.

For example, here is the mapping from Core-AAM for an Element with [`aria-checked=true`](https://w3c.github.io/core-aam/#ariaCheckedTrue)

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th><abbr title="Microsoft Active Accessibility">MSAA</abbr> + IAccessible2 </th>
      <td>
        <span>State: <code>STATE_SYSTEM_CHECKED</code></span><br>
        <span>Object Attribute: <code>checkable:true</code></span>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th><abbr title="User Interface Automation">UIA</abbr></th>
      <td>
        <span>Property: <code>Toggle.ToggleState</code>: <code>On (1)</code></span><br>
        <span>Property: <code>SelectionItem.IsSelected</code>: <code>True</code> for <code>radio</code> and <code>menuitemradio</code></span>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th><abbr title="Accessibility Toolkit">ATK</abbr>/<abbr title="Assistive Technology-Service Provider Interface">AT-SPI</abbr></th>
      <td>
        <span>State: <code>STATE_CHECKABLE</code></span><br>
        <span>State: <code>STATE_CHECKED</code></span>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th><abbr title="macOS Accessibility Protocol">AX API</abbr></th>
      <td>
        <span>Property: <code>AXValue</code>: <code>1</code></span><br>
        <span>Property: <code>AXMenuItemMarkChar</code>: <code>âœ“</code> for <code>menuitemcheckbox</code> and <code>menuitemradio</code></span>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

And here is the mapping from HTML-AAM for a [`<button>`](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aam-1.0/#el-button):

## Prior art: Get Computed Label, Get Computed Role, potential WebDriver extensions

![Diagram showing how WebDriver supports getting the Computed Label and Computed Role for an element. Full description below.](assets/webdriver_accessibility_testing.png)

<details id="webdriver_accessibility_diagram">
<summary>Full image description</summary>
A block diagram.

This diagram extends the <a href="#user-content-accessibility_apis_diagram">diagram in the "accessibility tree and accessibility APIs" section</a>,
showing how the WPT application can query the browser's Webdriver API implementation
to request the computed role and computed label for an element.

It adds a block for the WPT application to the left of the Browser application,
below the assistive technology application block,
and a block within the Browser application for the WebDriver API implementation.

Where the assistive technology application queries the Platform API Mapping
via platform accessibility APIs,
the WPT application queries the WebDriver API implementation via HTTP.

Like the Platform API mapping adapter,
the WebDriver API implementation also queries the computed accessibility tree.
</details>

WebDriver and testharness.js support getting the computed accessibility [label](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver2/#get-computed-label) and [role](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver2/#get-computed-role) for a particular element.
This allows testing the two core properties for nodes in the computed, platform-independent accessibility tree, verifying that the first step of the process for supporting the platform accessibility APIs has been successfully completed for those properties.

Computing the platform-independent role is supported in the AAMs, particularly in HTML-AAM, by the addition to each mapping table of a "computed" row in addition to the platform-specific API rows. In the `<button>` example above, in fact, every API and the "Computed" mapping all defer to the WAI-ARIA mapping for the `"button"` role. When no equivalent ARIA role exists, the HTML element name with a prefix of `html-` is used, as in the mapping for [`<canvas>`](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aam-1.0/#el-canvas).

Name computation, meanwhile, is complex and important enough to get a whole spec to itself: [Accessible Name and Description Computation](https://www.w3.org/TR/accname-1.2/) - as well as [detailed steps for certain HTML elements](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aam-1.0/#accname-computation).

### Potential WebDriver extensions for accessibility

There is [a proposal](https://github.com/WICG/aom/issues/203) to add an extension to WebDriver
to allow accessing a full "computed accessibility node" for an element.

This would allow fetching a much more extensive set of computed accessibility properties for an element via WebDriver.
Like Computed Label and Computed Role, these would be querying the platform-independent, computed accessibility tree.

## Testing AAMs via platform accessibility APIs directly

![Diagram showing the proposed addition: querying the browser from WPT via the platform accessibility APIs. Full description below.](assets/platform_accessibility_api_testing.png)

<details>
<summary>Full image description</summary>
A block diagram.

This diagram extends the <a href="#user-content-webdriver_accessibility_diagram">diagram in the "Prior art" section</a>.

It adds a dotted line arrow from the WPT application to the Plaform API mapping adapter within the Browser application, indicating the addition proposed here to use the Platform Accessibility APIs directly to test the browser's support for those APIs.

Notably, while the existing mechanism for WPT to query the browser via WebDriver
communicates with the WebDriver API implementation within the browser via HTTP,
the proposed addition bypasses WebDriver to query the Platform API Mapping directly via Platform Accessibility APIs.
This matches the way that Assistive Technology communicates with the browser application.
</details>

We think testing the computed accessibility tree is extremely useful in itself,
and a good fit for the platform-independent nature of browser testing and WebDriver specifically.
We think it would be equally good to be able to directly test that each browser's platform API support conforms to the AAM specifications,
and that the ideal way to test that is to use the APIs directly,
matching the way that assistive technology communicates with the browser.
